        <h2>If your town bans pot shops, should it get tax revenue?</h2>

          <p>Who should share in the spoils of the new recreational marijuana industry? If pro-pot advocates get their way, it won’t be any of the more than 100 municipalities that have enacted bans, moratoriums, or tight limits on licensed marijuana operations.

          <p>Proponents of legalized marijuana are planning to push the Legislature to block cities and towns with such restrictions from receiving a single dime of the $150 million-plus in tax revenue the state could soon collect from retail cannabis sales.

          <p>It’s a long-shot idea, but backers hope there’s appeal in its moral simplicity. Their argument amounts to the familiar parable of the Little Red Hen: Why should those who refused to help bake the bread get to eat it?
